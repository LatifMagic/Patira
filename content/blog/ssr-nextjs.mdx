Server-side rendering (SSR) is a powerful technique that can significantly improve the performance and SEO capabilities of your web applications. In the context of Next.js, SSR plays a crucial role in delivering pre-rendered content to the client, resulting in faster load times and better search engine visibility.

## Why Server-Side Rendering in Next.js?

By harnessing server-side rendering in Next.js, you can achieve the following benefits:

- **Improved Performance**: SSR allows your Next.js application to serve fully rendered HTML content to the client, reducing the time it takes to load and display the page.
- **Enhanced SEO**: Search engines can easily crawl and index SSR pages, leading to better search engine rankings and visibility for your website.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Next.js SSR enables dynamic content updates without sacrificing performance, providing a seamless user experience.

## Server-Side Rendering Implementation in Next.js

To leverage server-side rendering in Next.js effectively, you can create a page that fetches data during the server-side rendering process. Below is a refined example demonstrating server-side rendering in Next.js:

1. Create a new file, such as `ServerSidePage.js`, within the `pages` directory of your Next.js project.

2. Implement the following code to define a component that fetches data during server-side rendering:

```jsx {4} showLineNumbers
// pages/ServerSidePage.js
import React from "react";

const ServerSidePage = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Server-Side Rendered Page</h1>
      <p>{data}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();

    return {
      props: {
        data,
      },
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    return {
      props: {
        data: null,
      },
    };
  }
}

export default ServerSidePage;
```
